# Mainconf
Mainconf is my personal set of scripts that unfold into routines that set up configuration files on Arch-based distros with XFCE and/or i3 desktop environments.

##### A few notes beforehand
Make sure you understand that some files are permanently deleted. The code is available for proper analysis in order to avoid potential config files in you system. This is optimized for i3 WM and XFCE DE. Other DE's or WM's will need some tweaking on your side to get it working.

##### Getting the process started
This repository is supposed to be cloned onto your user's current home folder (~). Having cloned the repo, set up the permissions for the various scripts and routines included (Described below). After that, the only necessary step is to execute the trigger script to get the process started.

```shell
chmod -R 700 ~/mainconf 
```

Executing the main script (main trigger):
```shell
~/mainconf/mainconf.sh
```
