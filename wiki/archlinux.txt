>>> This is a guide to arch linux installation commands <<<

1 - Check wether you have a UEFI or traditional BIOS system
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
- If nothing shows up, you have BIOS and don't have UEFI.
- In case you have UEFI, the partitioning is a little different.

2 - ping 8.8.8.8

3 - In case you need to connect to wifi
wifi-menu

4 - timedatectl set-ntp true

5 - Check drives and their partitions
lsblk

6 - fdisk /dev/sda
n
p
1
<enter>
+200M / 15G /

----> CREATE FOUR PARTITIONS
boot
swap
root
home 

write at the end of the creation of the partitions

7 - lsblk to check all partitions created

8 - Make filesystems
boot - mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
swap - mkswap /dev/sda2 and also swapon /dev/sda2
root - mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
home - mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4

9 - Mount all partitions
root - mount /dev/sda3 /mnt (ls /mnt to check whether "lost+found" exists there)

mkdir /mnt/home
mkdir /mnt/boot

boot - mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
home - mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home

10 - Main command to install arch (this takes a while)
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel vim

11 - Fstab configuration
genfstab -U /mnt
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
cat /mnt/etc/fstab --> to check everything is there

12 - Jumping into the system 
arch-chroot /mnt
--> Now you're no longer on the USB flash drive. You are on the arch installation.

13 - Network manager
pacman -S networkmanager
systemctl enable NetworkManager

14 - Grub (bootloader)
pacman -S grub.
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

15 - Setting up a password for the current user (root)
passwd

16 - Setting up locale
vim /etc/locale.gen
---> uncomment the languages that you want to enable on your system.

en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US ISO-8859-1

locale.gen
vim /etc/locale.conf
LANG=en-US.UTF8

17 - Setting up timezone
ls /usr/share/zoneinfo 
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Fortaleza /etc/localtime

18 - setting up hostname
vim /etc/hostname

19 -

exit
lsblk
umount -R /mnt
reboot 

20 - 
Login with your root account and the password previously set up
